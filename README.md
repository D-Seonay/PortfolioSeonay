# Portfolio
Hello, I'm Math√©o DELAUNAY aka Seonay, I've created this portfolio to introduce myself and my skills to a potential company or customer in order to encourage future collaboration.

### How the potfolio is made
My portfolio is divided into four sections, the first being a home page with a very short description of me.
The second is an "about me" page where you can see another description and photo of me, and you can see my skills.
The third is a "projects" section where you can see my projects and work experience.
Finally, the last page is a contact page. 

### With which technology
To realize this project, I used a Figma feed created before the design.
If you want, you can see my design with this link: **[Figma Portfolio](https://www.figma.com/file/1AuA6qTdz7uebIxE6pAFza/PortfolioV4?type=design&node-id=105%3A777&mode=design&t=1ZhOQUoUT1HU7qUN-1)**

The technologies used are HTML, SCSS and JS.
